Our Project Game:

We created the game "Quacked", a dungeon-crawler type game. 
Once you press "Play", a configuration screen will pop up. Here, you need to put in your name, select a duck character, 
select a weapon, and select a difficulty. The player must input a name and choose the options.
Once you've selected your options, you press the "play" button. This will lead to the initial game screen which displays the
roomGenerator and your starting gold based on the difficulty you selected. In the roomGenerator, currently we wanted to make sure it rendered
correctly, so each tile is labeled with either "NORTH" "SOUTH" "EAST" "WEST" "FLOOR" "WALL".

Current Tests:

-Test if Main Menu has play button
-Tests for each player customization options for config screen (ex: difficulty, weapon, etc.)
-Tests for if generated roomGenerator rendered correctly with all exits, walls, and floors
