Our Project Game:

We created the game "Quacked", a dungeon-crawler type game. 
Once you press "Play", a configuration screen will pop up. Here, you need to put in your name, select a duck character, 
select a weapon, and select a difficulty. The player must input a name and choose the options.
Once you've selected your options, you press the "play" button. This will lead to the initial game screen which displays the roomGenerator and 
your starting gold based on the difficulty you selected. 
For M5, we implemented the items and inventory. When a player defeats a monster, they have a random chance of dropping a random weapon. The player can 
pick up the item just by walking over it. Players interact with the chests scattered around the room by walking next to them and pressing C. 

Current Tests:

- Tests whether basic weapon attributes are correct
- Tests inventory creation and adding items to inventory affects size correctly
- Tests if the super potion works as intended and correct addition of items to inventory
- Tests duration of each potion and removal from inventory after use
- Tests attack potion attributes as well as health potion attributes.
