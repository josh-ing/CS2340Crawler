Our Project Game:

We created the game "Quacked", a dungeon-crawler type game. 
This is the final release! Optional challenge rooms are added, as well as a final boss and various attack animations. Upon death or successful win, an end screen
will be shown. This end screen will display 3 stats that the player as accumulated throughout their playthrough.

Current Tests:

- Tests whether chests deduct gold upon opening and checks if monsters drop gold upon death.
- Tests whether the boss attack is different from regular monster attacks and whether the player different attacks affect the boss.
- Tests whether the challenge totem spawns the correct amount of monsters as well as properly attacking the challenge totem.
- Tests whether the instructions button and end states work upon game over.
- Tests whether the effects and attack animations are spawned correctly for the boss.
